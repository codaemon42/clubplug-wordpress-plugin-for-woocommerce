# clubplug-wordpress-plugin-for-woocommerce

Clubplug is a woocommerce plugin. This plugin is designed specially for different clubs. Here is three types of memberships: 'monthly', 'premium monthly' & 'Lifetime'.
you can set different pricing for different types of membership. Most importantly you can also set a due date for every month and set a delay charge in percentage if any member fails to pay before due date.
Not only this, but also members need not pay the exact amount that is due for the member. The members can pay any fractions of the total due amount. 
Even the members can pay an advance amount. The advance amount is stored in your account as the member's balance and fortunately the plugin is able to auto pay and deduct the monthly membership cost from the balance after the due date.
